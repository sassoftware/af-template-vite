# Your SAS App Factory UI

Welcome to your SAS App Factory UI template! This UI is based on `Vite` with additional features tailored specifically for building modern Progressive Web Applications (PWA) that seamlessly integrate with App Factory Cloud.

As you begin customizing this template, here's a brief overview of what's included:

- Standard vite environment
- Built-in TypeScript support
- The `afcli` for syncing TypeScript definitions & hooks for App Factory Cloud functions & schemas
- Autoconfiguration for App Factory Cloud integration through `afcli`

## Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies:

```bash
# from the top level directory
npm install
```

2. Run the template in development mode:

```bash
# from the top level directory
npm start
```

This will launch the development server and open your app in the browser.

## Using afcli

This UI was generated using `@sassoftware/afcli create`. You can use `afcli` to sync new TypeScript definitions to your computer:

```bash
# from the top level directory
npx @sassoftware/afcli@latest sync
```

For more information on using the CLI, refer to our [official documentation](https://appfactory-docs.engage.sas.com) and our [react UI tutorial](https://appfactory-docs.engage.sas.com/4-tutorials/react/).

## Customizing the Template

Now that you have a basic understanding of the UI, you can start customizing it to fit your needs. Modify components, add new features, and tailor the application to create a truly unique experience for your users.

Remember to refer to the official [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) documentation and the official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for any guidance or best practices you might need.

Good luck, and happy coding!
